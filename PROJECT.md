# Word Laboratory — Project Guide

> **Read this first.** This is the canonical description of what Word Laboratory

## 1. What this project is (in one sentence)

**Word Laboratory is a dictionary for things humanity has felt, experienced or
imagined but never precisely named** — it understands the deep meaning of a
request first, then invents a new word for it that can actually be *used inside an
existing human language* (English, Russian, …).

It is **not** a random word generator, **not** a fantasy-language builder, and
**not** just an AI name generator. It does not replace human language — it
**expands** it by adding a new semantic word where ordinary vocabulary runs out.

The core promise to a user:

> Describe what language cannot yet express. The laboratory discovers the
> concept, creates a word for it, and shows you how to use it.

A Russian speaker keeps speaking Russian and says «я прошёл через **варетис**».
An English speaker keeps speaking English and says “I did not recover. I entered
**varethis**.” The invented word carries a concept that would otherwise take
several sentences.

## 2. The central principle: meaning first, word last

The generation order is **always**:

```
Meaning → Concept → Emotional Identity → Sound Architecture → Word → Use in Language
```

The most important object in the product is the **Concept**, not the Word and not
the Language. The word is a *vessel* for the concept; the phonetic system decides
how that vessel *sounds*.

If the meaning interpretation is wrong, everything downstream is wrong. So the lab
states its interpretation of the request **before** making any word, and (in the
target design) lets the user confirm or steer it.

Worked example — for the prompt
*“a word for becoming someone completely different after surviving something that
should have destroyed you”* — the lab must NOT grab surface words like *creation*,
*light*, *energy*. The real center is **irreversible identity transformation after
destruction**: death of the former self without physical death, grief for who you
were, strength born from damage. Only after naming that does it build words.

---

## 3. Current product pipeline (what actually runs today)

```
User prompt (one free-text field: "describe a meaning")
   ↓
Meaning Analysis            → api/analyze.ts (LLM) OR src/engine/meaning.ts (fallback)
   ↓
Laboratory Interpretation   → interpretation EN/RU, hidden concepts, concept network
   ↓
Language Discovery          → several distinct "linguistic species" chosen by meaning
   ↓
Language Genome             → each language's measurable DNA
   ↓
Word Synthesis + Evolution  → native-speaker words built from each language's phonotactics
   ↓
Word Passport               → meaning, pronunciation, transliteration, Use in Language,
                              Word Genome, Emotional DNA, personality, brand fit…
```

Results render **immediately** from the deterministic engine, then, if the LLM is
configured, **bespoke per-word meanings and usage sentences swap in progressively**.

### What a word currently ships with

- **Word** + **pronunciation guide** (stress-marked respelling, e.g. `eh-LEE-ah-yeh`).
- **Transliteration** into Cyrillic (e.g. `Varethis → варетис`), always present.
- **Part of speech** and a short one-line definition.
- **Meaning** — a specific, dictionary-style definition (EN with a fluent RU in
  parentheses), tailored to the prompt when the LLM is on.
- **Use in Language** — natural example sentences in English and Russian that show
  how the word actually functions in a sentence (LLM-written).
- **Word Genome / Emotional DNA / Personality / Brand Fit / origin explanation.**

## 4. Positioning & voice

Use this language:

- “A dictionary for things humanity has felt but never named.”
- “Describe what language cannot express.”
- Discovery verbs: *Interpreting… · Meaning layers detected · Word discovered.*

Avoid this language:

- “AI name generator”, “random word generator”, “build your own language”,
  “generating names…”, “here are your results”, “inspired by”.

There are (eventually) **two modes** that must not be blended into one generic
generator:

- **Meaning Discovery** (primary) — for unnamed human experiences and concepts.
  Optimises for semantic precision, emotional recognition, natural usage.
- **Naming** (secondary) — for brands, products, characters. Optimises for brand
  fit, memorability, domain/trademark potential.

---

## 5. Honesty rules (important for trust)

The interface may feel mysterious, but the system must stay honest. Always keep
these distinct and never fake them:

1. **Real etymology** vs **creative linguistic influence.** A newly invented word
   does NOT historically descend from Greek/Latin. Say *“constructed using phonetic
   patterns associated with …”*, never *“comes from Ancient Greek.”*
2. **Measured data** vs **estimated data.** Do not print fake precision
   (“Originality: 100%”, or 97/96/95 on everything). Prefer qualitative bands
   (Low / Moderate / High / Exceptional) unless there is a real scoring basis, and
   state when a check has *not* been performed (e.g. “external collision check not
   yet done”).
3. **AI-generated interpretation** is labelled as such (“Read by AI” badge) vs the
   built-in engine.

---

## 6. Architecture

The heart of the project is a **framework-agnostic, pure-TypeScript engine** in
[`src/engine/`](src/engine): no React, no DOM, no network. This keeps the
meaning-first pipeline fully unit-testable and lets any step be swapped for an LLM
without touching the rest.

### The "single seam"

`analyzeMeaning()` (concept analysis) is the one function an LLM replaces to reach
open-ended understanding. The LLM endpoint returns the **same `MeaningAnalysis`
shape** the engine already consumes, so language discovery, word synthesis and
passports are unchanged whether the analysis came from the LLM or the fallback.

### Engine files

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `types.ts` | The type system — `MeaningAnalysis`, `WordGenome`, `LanguageGenome`, `WordEvolution`, `WordFamily`, `WordPassport`, `Ancestry`. |
| `meaning.ts` | The Meaning Engine fallback. `analyzeMeaning()` reads the prompt, recognises a human theme, produces interpretation + hidden concepts + network. **The single seam.** |
| `concepts.ts` | Meaning → Concept: builds the weighted concept vector. |
| `phonetics.ts` | Phonetic primitives — syllables, vowel ratio, clusters, pronounceability, symmetry. |
| `synth.ts` | Word Evolution → Word: synthesises diverse *native-speaker* words from a language's phonotactics (no root-gluing; real internal diversity). |
| `genome.ts` | Computes a word's phonetic **Word Genome** + quality score. |
| `language.ts` | Computes the **Language Genome** and each word's evolution profile. |
| `emotional.ts` | Emotional DNA from language signature + concepts + genome. |
| `pronounce.ts` | Deterministic spoken **pronunciation guide** (stress-marked respelling). |
| `translit.ts` | Deterministic Latin → **Cyrillic transliteration** (so words can live in Russian). |
| `pronunciation.ts` | Cross-language pronounceability star ratings. |
| `brand.ts` | Brand / industry matching. |
| `narrative.ts` | Concept-first meaning, explanation, story, phonetic ancestry, personality. |
| `generator.ts` | Orchestrates the pipeline: `runLaboratory`, `generateFamilies`, `buildPassport`, `discoverFromAnalysis`. |
| `rng.ts` | Seeded RNG (mulberry32) → deterministic, shareable results. |
| `data/languages.ts` | The languages / "species": 8 original (Crystalline, Liquid, Verdant, Noble, Ancient, Ethereal, Earthen, Solar) + 4 meaning-driven (Ashen, Phoenix, Obsidian, Chrysalis). Each is a sound world with phoneme inventory, cadence, stress, philosophy-first description. |
| `data/ideas.ts` | Concept → idea vocabulary: clear definitions (EN + RU) + poetic material. |
| `data/concepts.ts` | Keyword → concept map. |
| `data/patterns.ts` | Phrase → concept patterns that recover *implied* meaning. |
| `data/themes.ts` | Recognised human themes (metamorphosis, grief, resilience) + preferred languages. |
| `data/modes.ts` | Creative-mode profiles (bias which languages a run favours). |
| `data/known-words.ts` | Blocklist for the novelty check. |

### Server (optional, LLM)

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `api/analyze.ts` | LLM Meaning Analysis. Returns the `MeaningAnalysis` shape. `501` if no key, `502` on failure → client falls back to the engine. |
| `api/meanings.ts` | LLM "living dictionary" pass: per word writes meaning EN/RU, short definition, part of speech, and 2 EN + 2 RU natural usage sentences (uses the exact Cyrillic spelling passed in). |

- The **API key lives only on the server** (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`), never in the browser.
- `WORDLAB_MODEL` overrides the model (default `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` for
  speed/cost; use `claude-sonnet-5` / `claude-opus-4-8` for deeper, slower reads).
- Functions set `maxDuration: 60` (Vercel Hobby ceiling) so the meanings pass does
  not time out. See `vercel.json` and each function's `config`.

### Client (thin presentational layer)

`src/App.tsx` (single-input flow, progressive enhancement) over
`src/components/`: `InterpretationPanel`, `LanguageTree`, `LanguageSection`,
`PassportCard`, `Logo`. Build-time constants `__APP_VERSION__` / `__BUILD_SHA__` /
`__BUILD_TIME__` are injected via `vite.config.ts` `buildDefine()` and shown as a
footer **build stamp** so a fresh deploy is detectable by refreshing.

## 7. Product direction (the restructure)

The project is mid-transition from "meaning-first name discovery" to the full
**dictionary of unnamed experience**. The end-state pipeline adds a confirmation
loop and a personal lexicon:

```
Prompt → Interpretation → Hidden layers → Semantic tensions → Concept directions
       → (user confirms/steers) → Sound architecture → Words → Word Passport
       → Use in Language → Adoption test → Evolve → Save to Lexicon
```

### Phased plan & status

| Phase | Scope | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| — | Meaning-first engine, language discovery, genomes, passports | ✅ done |
| — | LLM meaning analysis via serverless function (key-safe, graceful fallback) | ✅ done |
| — | Bespoke per-word meanings | ✅ done |
| — | Pronunciation guide + Cyrillic transliteration | ✅ done |
| **14** | **Use in Language** — EN/RU usage sentences, part of speech, short def | ✅ done |
| **1** | **Semantic Tensions** + optional "Refine the reading" steer chips (non-blocking, LLM-only) | ✅ done |
| **2** | **Concept Directions** — 3–5 distinct angles; focus word discovery on one or combine two (non-blocking re-weight). `Concept` persistence deferred to Phase 6. | ✅ done |
| 3 | Word discovery from *independent* phonetic strategies (no template mutation) | ⏳ planned |
| 5 | Adoption Test — qualitative first, transparent numeric score later | ⏳ planned |
| 6 | Personal Lexicon — save/search/collections/history | ⏳ planned |
| 7 | Evolve the word — change sound while preserving concept; parent/child lineage | ⏳ planned |
| 8 | External checks — dictionary / brand / domain / trademark / cross-language negatives | ⏳ later |

### Design tension to respect

The user has explicitly asked for a **maximally simple single input field**. The
richer flow (concept directions, confirmation) must therefore be **progressive and
optional** — show interpretation + directions as *results* the user can accept or
refine, not as forced steps before any output. Do not reintroduce mandatory
multi-step forms without confirming with the user.

### Quality bars for a good generation

1. The interpretation accurately reflects the prompt (user recognises their idea).
2. Concept directions are meaningfully different.
3. Final words are phonetically diverse — NOT suffix mutations of one root
   (bad: `Vareth / Varethis / Varethon / Varethix`; good: `Varethis / Saelor /
   Korvain / Eluneth / Morakai / Avere`).
4. Every word preserves the selected concept.
5. At least one word is naturally usable in a sentence.
6. Definitions are specific, not generic poetry.
7. Scores and claims are transparent (see Honesty rules).

## 8. How to run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # dev server
npm run build      # type-check (tsc -b) + production build
npm test           # engine test suite (vitest)
npm run typecheck  # types only
```

Use the engine directly, no UI:

```ts
import { runLaboratory } from './src/engine'

const { analysis, families } = runLaboratory({
  brief: 'a word for the feeling of a perfect moment ending while you are still inside it',
  keywords: [],
  count: 6, // number of languages to discover
})

console.log(analysis.interpretation)
console.log(families[0].words[0].word, families[0].words[0].transliteration)
```

Generation is **deterministic** for a given request (and optional `seed`), so
results are reproducible and shareable. The LLM passes are non-deterministic and
are layered on top progressively.

---

## 9. Deploy & environment

- Static Vite frontend + optional `/api/*` serverless functions. `vercel.json`
  sets framework, build command, output dir, and `maxDuration: 60` for `api/*`.
- **Enable the LLM:** set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in Vercel → Settings → Environment
  Variables. Optional `WORDLAB_MODEL`. See `.env.example`.
- Every push to the production branch redeploys. The footer build stamp
  (`v… · build … · … UTC`) confirms which build is live.
- Because the frontend is fully static, it also runs on Netlify / Cloudflare Pages
  / any bucket (without the LLM passes).

---

## 10. Conventions for agents working here

- **Never break the meaning-first order.** Meaning/Concept comes before any word.
- **Keep the engine pure.** No React/DOM/network inside `src/engine/`. LLM and UI
  live outside it and depend on the engine, never the reverse.
- **Preserve the single seam.** Anything the LLM produces must fit the existing
  `MeaningAnalysis` / passport shapes so the deterministic fallback keeps working.
- **The app must always work without the LLM.** Every LLM call has a graceful
  fallback; the key never reaches the browser.
- **Follow the honesty rules** (section 5). No fake etymology or fake precision.
- **Determinism:** engine output must stay deterministic for a seed. Do not use
  `Date.now()` / `Math.random()` in the engine — use the seeded `Rng`.
- **Tests:** add/extend `src/engine/engine.test.ts` for engine changes
  (36 tests today). Run `npm test` and `npm run build` before committing.
- **Build stamp:** bump `package.json` `version` on user-visible changes so the
  footer stamp shifts and a live deploy is verifiable by refreshing.
- **Docs:** if you change product direction or architecture, update THIS file.

## 11. Glossary

- **Concept** — the meaning being named; the central, stable entity. One concept
  can spawn many words.
- **Linguistic species / Language** — a self-consistent sound world with its own
  Language Genome. Repositioned in the target design as a **phonetic / sound
  architecture** (how a meaning sounds), not a fictional nation.
- **Language Genome** — a language's measurable DNA (consonant density, vowels,
  cadence, stress, entropy, mutation rate, emotional gravity, endings…).
- **Word Genome** — a single word's measurable phonetic profile; Emotional DNA and
  brand fit are read *off* it.
- **Word Passport** — the full deliverable for one word.
- **Use in Language** — the section proving the word can enter real speech, with
  natural EN/RU example sentences and a Cyrillic form.
- **Speech Adoption** — the target evaluation: can this word actually enter human
  speech? (More important than raw originality.)
- **Personal Lexicon** — a user's saved vocabulary of discovered concepts/words
  (planned; expected to be a key retention feature).

---

*Long-term ambition: create words so meaningful, natural and useful that some of
them eventually enter real human speech.*
